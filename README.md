# FlappyBird
This project was created using an FRDM-K64F board and an Adafruit 128x32 I2C OLED display. The display was put onto a breadboard and wired to pins on the board. The code in this repository enables the board to communicate with the display using I2C protocols and controls the flow of the game. All interfacing with the display was done using the assistance of 2 MBED libraries (os-mbed and Adafruit_GFX). All updates to the game state are done using an interrupt handler which occurs 30 times a second to ensure gameplay is smooth. Additionally, we used the SW3 switch on the board to take in user input to enable to users bird to "flap".

To run this game you will need to purchase an FRDM-K64F board and an Adafruit 128x32 I2C OLED display. You will then need a breadboard and wires and will need to wire the board using the correct pins. A pin diagram for the board can be easily obtained online. You will then need to create an [MBED](https://os.mbed.com/) and download the os-mbed and Adafruit_GFX libraries. After doing this the game should run and show up on the display.
